# Antenna-Dataset
This dataset is prepared for YOLO object detection model training, specifically focused on detecting antennas. 

The dataset contains two subsets:
1. General Antenna Dataset (`antenna_dataset`): Includes training and validation data with images and YOLO-format labels.
2. Data with Sunlight Effects (`Data with sunlight`): Includes training and testing data under challenging lighting conditions (e.g., direct sunlight), separated into images and labels.

All annotations in this dataset were auto-annotated and have not been manually reviewed or corrected.

Annotations are provided in YOLO format to ensure compatibility with YOLO training pipelines.

Data Source
The images in this dataset were collected from publicly available YouTube videos. These videos were carefully selected to ensure a diverse and representative collection of antenna-related images.
